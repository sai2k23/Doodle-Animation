# üé® Doodle Animation

A fun and simple web project showcasing a hand-drawn or **"doodle" style animation**. This project was created to practice and demonstrate fundamental animation techniques using front-end web technologies.

## ‚ú® About The Project

The primary goal of this project was to bring a static doodle design to life using code. We focused on creating a smooth, captivating animation that maintains the aesthetic of a quickly drawn sketch.

**What We Did:**

* **HTML Structure:** Created the foundational structure for the animation canvas or elements.
* **CSS Styling & Animation:** Used **CSS Keyframes** and transitions to define the movement, colors, and timing of the doodle elements. We meticulously crafted the animation properties to ensure the movement felt fluid and natural, mimicking a real drawing process.
* **JavaScript Interactivity (Optional):** Implemented **JavaScript** to handle any dynamic behavior, such as controlling the animation sequence, responsiveness, or simple user interaction (if included).
* **Design Focus:** Ensured the visual style remained simple and engaging, capturing the essence of a charming doodle.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** (Structure)
* **CSS3** (Styling and Animation using Keyframes)
* **JavaScript** (For dynamic control and timing)
